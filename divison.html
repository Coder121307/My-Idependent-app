            So what is division? Divison is a math application which is done by spliting a number by a diffrent one. The divison symbol is a dash with a period on top and bottom of it. The first number in the equation is called the dividend, and the second number is the divisor. An example 4 รท 2 so you have 4 the number your dividing then you have 2, so what your testing is how many 2's can fit in 4 so in this case the anwser is 2, another example is 96 รท 4 so 96 can hold 24 4's so the the answer is 24. A real life example is, say you order a pizza with 12 slices and you have 4 people including yourself. You can divide this pizza equally by taking the pizza as the dividend and the number of people as the divisor. so you have 12 รท 4 = ? so you do it like 4 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 so you know that 3 4's make 1 twelve so each of your friends get 3 slices each.
